# Report Generator Project

This project is a small report generator designed for learning purposes. It integrates PostgreSQL with Python, incorporates data from an Excel document, and generates a PDF report. The database contains personal data on imaginary employees, while the Excel document contains performance scores for each employee. These datasets are combined, sorted by scores, and the result is written to a PDF file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eliagiac/report-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd report-generator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running on your system.

2. Create a PostgreSQL database and import the provided example database using the SQL dump file provided (`sql\employees.sql`).

3. Set the `password` variable to you chosen password. The default value is `0000`.

5. Run the Python script `src\main.py`:
   ```bash
   python src\main.py
   ```

6. The script will fetch data from the database, combine it with performance scores from the Excel file in`reports\performance\employee-performance.xlsx`, sort it by scores, and generate a PDF report (`report-{date}.pdf`) in the `reports\full` directory.

## Project Structure

- `employees.sql`: SQL dump file containing an example PostgreSQL database.
- `employee-performance.xlsx`: Example Excel file containing performance scores for employees.
- `main.py`: Main Python script responsible for generating the report.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- `report-{date}.pdf`: Output PDF report generated by the script.

## Libraries Used

- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and analysis.
- [`psycopg2`](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/): PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
- [`fpdf`](https://pypi.org/project/fpdf/): For generating PDF files in Python.
